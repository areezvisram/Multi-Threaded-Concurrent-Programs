# Multi-Threaded Concurrent Programs Repository

This repository contains a collection of multi-threaded concurrent programs implemented in Go, C, Python, and Java. Each folder corresponds to a specific programming language and contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various concurrent programming examples and techniques.

## Introduction

Concurrency is an essential aspect of modern software development, enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently utilize system resources. This repository aims to explore different concurrent programming paradigms and provide practical examples in Go, C, Python, and Java.

## Programs

The repository is organized into four main folders, each focusing on a different programming language:

1. `go/`: Contains Go language concurrent programs in Jupyter Notebooks.
2. `c/`: Holds C language concurrent programs in Jupyter Notebooks.
3. `python/`: Includes Python language concurrent programs in Jupyter Notebooks.
4. `java/`: Consists of Java language concurrent programs in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Usage

Each language-specific folder contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each demonstrating a unique concurrent programming concept or problem solution. To explore the programs, navigate to the desired language folder and open the Jupyter Notebook files using your Jupyter environment.

Each program has already been executed and the output can be seen 
in the notebook. Furthermore, each program has a description of what the program does and how it achieves that using concurrent techniques.
