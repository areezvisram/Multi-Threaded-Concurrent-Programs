# Go Concurrent Programs

This directory contains concurrent programs implemented in Go, showcased using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration.

## Fibonacci

The notebook `fibonacci.ipynb` demonstrates a concurrent implementation to calculate the first 19 Fibonacci numbers using message passing. The program utilizes the power of Go's goroutines and channels to efficiently perform the calculations concurrently.

## Priority Queue

The notebook `priority_queue.ipynb` showcases a concurrent implementation of a PriorityQueue in Go. The program utilizes message passing through channels to handle incoming messages and return them sorted by priority. This provides an efficient way to manage priorities in a concurrent environment.
