# Python Concurrent Programs

This directory contains concurrent programs implemented in Python, showcased using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration.

## Fair Reader Writer

The notebook `fair_reader_writer.ipynb` demonstrates a fair solution to the classic Readers-Writers problem in Python using threads and semaphores. The program ensures that both readers and writers get equal opportunities to access the shared resource without causing starvation.

## Sleeping Barber

The notebook `sleeping_barber_monitors.ipynb` showcases an implementation of the Sleeping Barber problem in Python using monitors, threads, and semaphores. The program models the scenario of a barber shop with multiple customers and a limited number of available seats.
