    "There exists a barbershop with one barber, one barber chair, and a waiting room with n chairs (n may be 0) for waiting customers. The following rules apply:\n",
    "- If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep in the chair\n",
    "- A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep\n",
    "- If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are occupied and sits in an empty chair if it's available\n",
    "- When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none"
